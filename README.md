# Word to PDF Converter

## Description

The Word to PDF Converter is a Python program that allows you to convert multiple Word documents (*.docx) to PDF format using the docx2pdf library. The program provides a user-friendly interface using the Tkinter library for selecting the input Word documents and the output folder for saving the converted PDF files.

## Installation

To use the Word to PDF Converter, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
Install the required libraries by running the following command:
    
    ```pip install python-docx docx2pdf

## Usage

To convert Word documents to PDF, follow these steps:

Run the program by executing the script word_to_pdf_converter.py.
A dialog box will appear asking you to select the Word documents to convert. Select one or more Word documents by holding the Ctrl key or using Shift to select a range.
Once the Word documents are selected, another dialog box will appear asking you to choose the output folder where the converted PDF files will be saved. Select a folder and click OK.
The program will convert each selected Word document to PDF and save it in the output folder. A message box will display the status of each conversion.
After all conversions are complete, you can find the converted PDF files in the selected output folder.
